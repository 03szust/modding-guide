# Creating a Quest

At first you should think about what kind of Quest you would like to have.  
The vanilla game offers several templates for different kinds of quests (search templates.xml for `<Name>QuestTypes</Name>`), mostly different regarding their WinCondition and some prefilled text. Using the correct template will make it a bit easier, but is not mandatory. Since all Quest templates have as far as I know the very same properties, you can use any of them and replace the values like you want and use any WinCondition and combine them like you want.

For this Tutorial we will create 2 simple Quests (search assets.xml of the game for vanilla examples of other quest types):
- a A7_QuestSustain quest, like "own X for a time of Y".
- a delivery quest (deliver product x with a ship to kontor of Y) using template A7_QuestDeliveryObject

## - A7_QuestSustain
