# Tutorial 4 - Making a new ship

The previous tutorial was a really big one. For the next one we are going to do something smaller but with a big new part, changing models in Blender.

## What are we going to do?

We are ging to use an existing model from the game to make a new small cargoship and adapt it in Blender to create a new one. Then we will be changing the diff map a bit to give it some unique visuals.

We will be creating:

- New ship asset for Small Cargo Ship
- Adding the ship to the steam shipyard
- Adding the ship to the tradeship pool
- Make trigger
- New model + textures/maps for Small cargoship
- Icon for Small cargoship

## Our mod structure

This is already the 4th tutorial so we begin to know the structure of a mod. This mod has some specific folders.

- [Gameplay] Small Cargo Ship
  - data
    - config
      - export
        - main
          - asset
            - xml file (assets.xml) which contains all the logic for our mod.
      - gui
        - xml files containing the translations for text in every language
          - texts_english.xml
          - texts_french.xml
          - texts_german.xml
          - â€¦
    - graphics
      - small_cargoship.cfg and small_cargoship.ifo file with model logic.
      - icons
        - Custom graphics we use in our mod. Icon for our ship.
      - vehicle
        - small_cargoship (Contains files that describes the new ship)
          - maps  
             Contains maps which are the materials/textures of our ship. diff file only in this case.
          - rdm
            Contains the new model we will be creating

## The asset for the ship

We have done some modding and start to know how to search, adapt and create new or existing assets. We are going to create a ship. So, the easiest way to create one is to use a basic ship as an example and adapt it.

Go to the main assets.xml of the latest data.rda file and search for &lt;Template>TradeShip&lt;/Template>.
The moment of making this tutorial, you will have 46 results. Those are all tradeships that are used in the game. Not only ships that are available for yourself, but also curstom versions from AI and quests are in this list.

Go to the 4th result. This is the Tradeship with GUID "1010062". This is called "Collier (Trade)", but in fact is the Cargo ship. We will use this as the base to create our smaller version.

Copy the whole &lt;Asset> of this ship to your main assets.xml inside a &lt;ModOp>.

```XML
<ModOps>
    <!-- START SHIP - SMALL CARGOSHIP -->
    <ModOp Type="addPrevSibling" GUID='1010062'>

### Cleanup and changing the ship asset

First we are going to go through the whole asset and clean up the code we do not need. The same time we will be changing the values to make our ship different from the main Cargo ship.

Let's go over everything we did:

#### GUID, Name and description

We choose a new GUID for this ship. We ended with the GUID 1742008812 in the last tutorial. So we are going to take the next GUID available, **&lt;GUID>1742008813&lt;/GUID>** for this ships name. For the description we take **&lt;InfoDescription>1742008814&lt;/InfoDescription>**.

```XML
<Standard>
    <GUID>1742008813</GUID>
    <Name>Small Cargo Ship</Name>
    <IconFilename>data/graphics/icons/icon_small_cargo_ship.png</IconFilename>
    <InfoDescription>1742008814</InfoDescription>
</Standard>
```

We do not have created the icon yet, but we can already declare the path to the icon. **&lt;IconFilename>data/graphics/icons/icon_small_cargo_ship.png&lt;/IconFilename>**.

We change the name to &lt;Name>Small Cargo Ship&lt;/Name>.

#### cfg model variation

We also do not have created the cfg model yet, but again, we already declare the correct path to this file we will be creating later on. **<Filename>data/graphics/vehicle/small_cargo_ship/small_cargo_ship.cfg</Filename>**

We remove the &lt;Skins> part. We do not have skins.

```XML
<Object>
    <Variations>
        <Item>
            <Filename>data/graphics/vehicle/small_cargo_ship/small_cargo_ship.cfg</Filename>
        </Item>
    </Variations>
</Object>
```

#### Mesh / Selection

We do not change anything here. We want the same behaviour for our ships.

#### Walking

In this part we will be changing some of the values, depending on what we want to give our ship as specifications (speed, length,...).

This smaller version will be faster, more agile but will have more effect of slowdowns. So we adapt the values according to that. See original values of the Cargo Ship next to it.

```XML
<Walking>
    <ShortenSailsAfter>0</ShortenSailsAfter>
    <ReservationLength>12</ReservationLength> <!-- Original Cargo Ship - 16 -->
    <ReservationWidth>5</ReservationWidth> <!-- Original Cargo Ship - 6 -->
    <PathPlannerLayer>Water</PathPlannerLayer>
    <ExpensiveDirSmoothing>1</ExpensiveDirSmoothing>
    <TurnAroundRadius>4</TurnAroundRadius> <!-- Original Cargo Ship - 8 -->
    <Acceleration>2.5</Acceleration> <!-- Original Cargo Ship - 1.5 -->
    <Deceleration>1.5</Deceleration> <!-- Original Cargo Ship - 2 -->
    <TurnRadius>4</TurnRadius> <!-- Original Cargo Ship - 8 -->
    <TurnSpeedInPlace>30</TurnSpeedInPlace> <!-- Original Cargo Ship - 20 -->
    <TurnDeceleration>0</TurnDeceleration>
    <TurnMovement>0</TurnMovement>

```

#### Text

```XML
<Text>Small Cargo Ship</Text>
```

#### CommandQueue

For the &lt;CommandQueue> we choose some different values. The TradeShipPoints we can change to 2.

```XML
<CommandQueue>
    <FormationPriority>1</FormationPriority>
    <TradeShipPoints>2</TradeShipPoints>
    <PriorityShipList>2</PriorityShipList>
</CommandQueue>
```

#### Drifting

We do not change anything here. We want the same behaviour for our ships. We maybe could adapt some values, but it will nog have that big of an impact.

#### Attackable

Important part where we will be choosing some values of our ship. We look at the values of the normal Cargo Ship and change those values according to that.

```XML
<Attackable>
    <MaximumHitPoints>1500</MaximumHitPoints>
    <HPBarOffset>4</HPBarOffset>
    <AlertRange>150</AlertRange>
    <SelfHealPerHealTick>1.2</SelfHealPerHealTick>
    <SelfHealPausedTimeIfAttacked>30000</SelfHealPausedTimeIfAttacked>
</Attackable>
```

#### MinimapToken

Nothing to change here. This defines which icon to use on the minimap. The icons are ok.

#### SoundEmitter

We can just take the same sounds as from the normal Cargo Ship. So we do not change anything here.

#### ItemContainer

Another interesting part. We can define here how many itemsockets and cargo holds the ship gets. We want to balance our ship offcourse, and it is a smaller version of the normal Cargo Ship so we choose only 1 item socket and 2 cargo holds.

**Good to know**: There is a maximum of slots that are available in the UI, so adding 10 slots for example will not have the best effect.

The &lt;SocketAllocation> values stay the same. This is also a ship, Steamship and Tradeship. Those values define which items will be possible to put into the item socket. For example, military ship items will not be possible to put into this ship, or other specialists who have nothing to do with ships.

```XML
<ItemContainer>
    <SocketCount>1</SocketCount>
    <SocketAllocation>Ship;SteamShip;Tradeship</SocketAllocation>
    <SlotCount>2</SlotCount>
</ItemContainer>
```

#### Draggable

We can leave this as is.

#### Cost

The normal costs for steamships exists of Steel Beams and Steam Motors. We will be adding also some Timber. We adapt the values for the existing materials compared to the normal Cargo Ship.

For influence we do the same.

```XML
<Cost>
    <Costs>
        <Item>
            <Ingredient>1010196</Ingredient> <!-- Timber -->
            <Amount>5</Amount>
        </Item>
        <Item>
            <Ingredient>1010218</Ingredient> <!-- Steel Beams -->
            <Amount>5</Amount>
        </Item>
        <Item>
            <Ingredient>1010224</Ingredient> <!-- Steam Motors -->
            <Amount>5</Amount>
        </Item>
    </Costs>
    <InfluenceCostType>TradeShip</InfluenceCostType>
    <InfluenceCostPoints>1</InfluenceCostPoints>
</Cost>
```

#### Craftable

The duration it takes to build the ship. The normal Cargo Ship takes 540 000 miliseconds to build. That is 540 seconds and is 9 minutes. Our smaller variation will only take 3 minutes to build, so 180 000 miliseconds.

```XML
<Craftable>
    <CraftingTime>180000</CraftingTime>
</Craftable>
```

#### ExpeditionAttribute

If we send our ship on an expedition, what proporties does it have. We change the values according to what the normal Cargo Ship has. We remove the might because without an amount it has no value being there.

```XML
<ExpeditionAttribute>
    <BaseMorale>35</BaseMorale>
    <ExpeditionAttributes>
        <Item>
            <Attribute>Navigation</Attribute>
            <Amount>10</Amount>
        </Item>
        <Item>
            <Attribute>PerkTradeShip</Attribute>
            <Amount>1</Amount>
        </Item>
        <Item>
            <Attribute>PerkSteamShip</Attribute>
            <Amount>1</Amount>
        </Item>
    </ExpeditionAttributes>
</ExpeditionAttribute>
```

#### ShipMaintenance

The maintenance cost in coins, upkeep cost for this ship. We should balance this offcourse.

```XML
<ShipMaintenance>
    <Maintenance>125</Maintenance>
</ShipMaintenance>
```

#### Sellable

Change the amount to a balanced value compared to the existing amount.

```XML
<Sellable>
    <Baseprice>
        <Item>
            <VectorElement>
                <InheritedIndex>0</InheritedIndex>
                <InheritanceMapV2>
                    <Entry>
                        <TemplateName>TradeShip</TemplateName>
                        <Index>0</Index>
                    </Entry>
                </InheritanceMapV2>
            </VectorElement>
            <Amount>125000</Amount>
        </Item>
    </Baseprice>
</Sellable>
```

#### SoundEmitterCommandBarks

We can just leave all the same voice commands for this ship.

### Add ship to steam shipyard

To be able to build the ship, we have to add the new ship to the buildingmenu of the steam shipyard.
The best startingpoint in this case is the steam shipyard. We search for &lt;Template>Shipyard&lt;/Template> to find the different shipyards. The one with GUID **1010521** is the steam shipyard.

If we look at that asset we can find a part where we have a list of <Vehicle> nodes. We need to add our new ship to that list as a new &lt;Vehicle>. This is inside the &lt;AssemblyOptions>.

```XML
...
<Shipyard>
    <AssemblyOptions>
        <Item>
            <Vehicle>1010062</Vehicle>
        </Item>
        <Item>
            <Vehicle>100442</Vehicle>
        </Item>
        <Item>
            <Vehicle>100443</Vehicle>
        </Item>
        <Item>
            <Vehicle>100853</Vehicle>
        </Item>
        <Item>
            <Vehicle>118718</Vehicle>
        </Item>
    </AssemblyOptions>
</Shipyard>
...
```

In this case, we actually want to add our new ship right before the normal Cargo Ship. So we have to do a specific type of ModOp.

The type we will be using is **Type="addPrevSibling"**, where we define a GUID inside the tree where we want to add our new asset as a previous sibling. We want to do this inside our Steam shipyard. Let's have a look at the code and break it down.

```XML
<!-- START ADD SHIPS TO STEAM SHIPYARD -->
<ModOp Type="addPrevSibling" GUID='1010521' Path="/Values/Shipyard/AssemblyOptions/Item[Vehicle='1010062']">
    <Item>
        <Vehicle>1742008813</Vehicle> <!-- Small Cargoship -->
    </Item>
</ModOp><!-- END ADD SHIPS TO STEAM SHIPYARD -->
```

We start with defining the **Type** of action we want to take. In this case as we said, the **addPrevSibling**.

Then we define in which asset we want to do that action, in our case the Steam Shipyard (GUID **1010521**), so we put the GUID of the Steam shipyard there. We already got that GUID from before, if not you can look it up again.

The the tricky part emerges, the path. Go back to the main assets.xml and go back to the steam shipyard asset. Go down the asset tree to look which path we need to take to get to the part where the different Items are inserted. In this case the last node which contains all the Vehicles/Items is **&lt;AssemblyOptions>**. So our path is **/Values/Shipyard/AssemblyOptions/**. But we are not ready with our path yet. We have to define specificly before which item we want to add our asset as a sibling. We do this by adding **Item[Vehicle='1010062']**, where **1010062** is the GUID of our normal Cargo Ship.

After that we add the &lt;Item> with the same &lt;Vehicle> structure as the other ships with our GUID **1742008813** of our new ship.

There we go, we added our ship to the steam shipyard.

### Add new ship to Trade ship pool

We are almost finished with our assets.xml, just 2 more steps. In this step we have to add our ship to the actual trade ship pool, so it is included in the different types of logic of a trade ship.

To do so, we look for the correct ship pool. We look for &lt;Template>ItemEffectTargetPool&lt;/Template> and look for the one **<Name>all tradeships NEW</Name>**. This has the GUID **193982**, so you could also look direcly for that asset with that GUID.

If we look at that asset we can see a list of **EffectTargetGUIDs**. We will add our new ship to that list with a new ModOp. This one is from the **Type="add"**. We use the GUID **193982** of the **ItemEffectTargetPool** and for the path we go down the asset tree to see the path we need to follow to add our new item to the list.

```XML
<!-- START ADD ItemEffectTargetPool -->
  <ModOp Type="add" GUID='193982' Path="/Values/ItemEffectTargetPool/EffectTargetGUIDs">
    <Item>
        <GUID>1742008813</GUID> <!-- Small Cargoship -->
    </Item>
</ModOp>
<!-- END ADD ItemEffectTargetPool -->
```

### Add the trigger

We are now at the last step of our assets.xml, we will be adding the trigger to unlock the ship.

In our case we will be unlocking this ship when the steam shipyard is unlocked. This is at 500 engineers.

We will be unhiding and unlocking the asset at the same time.

```XML
    <!-- START TRIGGER SMALL STEAM SHIPS -->
    <ModOp Type="addnextSibling" GUID="130248">
        <Asset>
            <Template>Trigger</Template>
            <Values>
                <Standard>
                    <GUID>1742008815</GUID>

                                        <UnlockAssets>
                                            <Item>
                                                <Asset>1742008813</Asset> <!-- Small Cargoship -->
                                            </Item>
                                        </UnlockAssets>
                                    </ActionUnlockAsset>
                                </Values>
                            </TriggerAction>

            </Values>
        </Asset>
    </ModOp>
    <!-- END TRIGGER SMALL STEAM SHIPS -->
```

So, there we go. We have now a working assets.xml, ready to use!

## Model for the ship

The next step will be an interesting one. We will be adapting an existing model of a ship to create a new model for our small Cargo Ship.

### Blender

For editing the model we use the free and open 3D creation software **Blender** (https://www.blender.org/). Download this and install it on your computer.

We have no intention of making tutorials of how to use Blender. We will do our best to be as clear as possible for what we need. For detailed tutorials you can find a lot of information already on the internet/Youtube. It is probabluy not a bad idea to have a look at some basic Blender tutorials. For example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw&ab_channel=BlenderGuru

### Plugins/Add-ons we need or should install to make our workflow easier

Blender is an amazing tool, but apart from the tool itself some Anno community wizards have created some amazing plugins/addons to make our workflow a lot easier. To be able to handle/import models and filetypes specificly for Anno in Blender or just converting files, we need some magic.

#### rdm4 converter

https://github.com/lukts30/rdm4

Models in Anno are defined as .rdm files. To be able to actually see those models on our computer we can use a rdm converter to for example convert those files to .glb files. .glb files can be opened with the standard 3D Viewer on a Windows computer.

#### texconv.exe

https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex

The converter lets us convert .dds files to for example .png files. We normally should already have installed this in previous tutorials, but we need this .exe file in a specific location to be accessible by Blender.

#### FileDBReader

https://github.com/anno-mods/FileDBReader

We are not going to use this in this tutorial but this is a powerful tool to convert multiple filetypes.

#### Blender-Anno-.cfg-Import-Addon

https://github.com/xormenter/Blender-Anno-.cfg-Import-Addon/releases

Amazing plugin for Blender that lets us import and export files to Anno specific filestypes. Powerful combined with the above tools.

#### Installation of the add-ons/plugins

Now that we have downloaded all those tools, let's make sure they are actually used by Blender and at the right location.

##### Add Mesh A.N.T.Landscape

- Go to **Edit** > **Preferences** .
- Select the Add-ons tab
- Search for **landscape**. In the list of available Add-ons you should see **Add Mesh A.N.T.Landscape**. Check this add-on to activate it.

![Blender Add Mesh A.N.T.Landscape](./_sources/blender-2.jpg)

##### Install Blender-Anno-.cfg-Import-Addon

Click in the same panel on the **Install** buttons and choose the downloaded **io_annocfg.zip** to install the add-on and check it to activate it.

Then we open the settings of this add-on. We have a couple of things we need to set up for our addon to work.

###### Path to rda folder

All the different rda files of our game contain the different models, textures for our buildings and other assets from all the different releases. To be able to use those we export all the rda files and merge those **data** folders together to 1 **data** folder where we can have all the models together.

![RDA export folder](./_sources/blender-4.jpg)

We need this path to that folder to set up our workflow for the Blender plugin to work and to pick up the materials and other assets when reusing those.

![Blender-Anno-.cfg-Import-Addon](./_sources/blender-3.jpg)

###### Paths to other tools

Apart from the rda folder we also need the paths to the **rdm4-bin.exe**, **texconv.exe** and **AnnoFCConverter.exe** all those tools we downloaded before. Put those together in a folder and link those paths in the add-on correctly as seen in the above screenshot.

We are now ready to start with Blender and have fun!

### Import and existing model

When we start Blender we see the following interface:

![Blender start](./_sources/blender-1.jpg)

It looks complicated and overwhelming. But with the basic tutorials you should have followed, you would have an idea of the basic things like moving, rotating, scaling, duplicating, the scene selection,...

We start with removing/deleting everyting from our scene. Then we have a clean scene to work on.

#### .cfg

The .cfg file is a Anno specific filetype. We already touched this filetype in the previous tutorial where we changed the path to our building for our Tea production building. But now, we will be importing this file. Because we will be doing this with the amazing add-on, Blender will recognise all the references to the model, materials, props in this file and put those as 3D models in Blender, for us to adapt.

**Good to know!** Make sure all paths are set correctly in the add-on in Blender. Also, make sure the rda exports are done correctly and in 1 data folder to make sure when importing in Blender everything can be linked correctly by the add-on.

Next, we import an existing .cfg file of an existing ship, for example, lets import the .cfg from the normal Cargo Ship. As mentioned above, we should have a data folder that contains all our assets.

The Cargo Ship is a ship that existed from the start of the game so it will be in the main **graphics** folder. Then we go to the **vehicle** folder and then we have the **collier** folder. Remember that that was the name of the Cargo Ship. Opening this shows all the files and folders of the Cargo Ship / Collier.

![Cargo Ship folder](./_sources/blender-6.jpg)

##### Import .cfg

To import the .cfg file we go in Blender to **File** > **Import** > **Anno (.cfg)**

![Import .cfg](./_sources/blender-5.jpg)

We will now see the Cargo Ship on our scene with the model and other specifications and assets.

![Collier Solid preview](./_sources/blender-7.jpg)

You probably see the model and assets without any materials/textures. If you do not know how to change this, To change to view change the Viewport Shading from Solid preview to **Material preview** in the upper right corner of the scene.

![Collier Material preview](./_sources/blender-8.jpg)

### Scene collection

If we take a look at the scene collection we se a big tree structure of different references.

![Scene collection](./_sources/blender-9.jpg)

#### MAIN_FILE_name.cfg

The main parent of our imported file is the **MAIN_FILE_name.cfg**. This contains everything linked to this specific parent file and those are 'children' of that file.

#### Animations, other FILE, IFOFILE, MODEL, PARTICLES, PROPCONTAINER

The children of our main parent all have different functions. We do not need all of them in all cases and we are not going to use all of them in this case.

We will be deleting the AMIMATIONS_SEQUENCE, all the FILE children, the MODEL children (we will be importing another model and adapt that one), some of the PARTICLE children and some of the props inside the PROPCONTAINER.

To make sure the whole tree underneath that children is deleted, right click and choose **Delete Hierarchy**.

![Scene collection - delete hierarchy](./_sources/blender-10.jpg)

For now we leave the rest of the assets as is and move them aside a bit deeper on our scene, because we will be importing another ship. Go back one level up to the **vehicle** folder and go to the **small_feedback_ship_01** folder. Inside this folder we have different .cfg files. Import **small_feedback_ship_01_b.cfg**.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b.cfg](./_sources/blender-11.jpg)

This is a ship we can not build ingame (yet). It is a small ship that is used for other things in the game, but we will be adapting this to make a smaller cargo ship that suits us and is buildable.

### Quick test

We could go crazy and actually **change the path in our assets.xml to the path of this .cfg file** and this would work perfectly.

Let's do this! Change the path to the path of the **small_feedback_ship_01_b.cfg** and maybe to make it quick, set the time to build the ship to 5 seconds to see the result almost immediatly.

```XML
<Object>
    <Variations>
        <Item>
            <!--<Filename>data/graphics/vehicle/small_cargo_ship/small_cargo_ship.cfg</Filename>-->
            <Filename>data/graphics/vehicle/small_feedback_ship_01/small_feedback_ship_01_b.cfg</Filename>
        </Item>
    </Variations>
</Object>
```

```XML
<Craftable>
    <CraftingTime>5000</CraftingTime>
</Craftable>
```

![small_feedback_ship_01_b ingame](./_sources/blender-12.jpg)
![small_feedback_ship_01_b ingame](./_sources/blender-13.jpg)

As you can see, we have not created a custom icon yet, but we are able to build and see our new ship already ingame. A small tiny ship.

### Adapting our model

Now that we actually have seen the ship ingame we can adapt that model so it suits our idea of a smaller cargo ship.

If we look at the tree structure of the **small_feedback_ship_01_b.cfg** we can see that this is less complex then the normal cargo ship. It does not have certain particles for explosions or debris when destroyed. That is because in normal gameplay this will never be attacked or destroyed. We could just use this ship as is and be done with it, but we are going a step further and will be adding all those things to this ship to make sure the experience ingame is the same as a normal ship.

#### Removing what we do not need

Let's remove everything that we are not going to use from the structure/tree of the small_feedback_ship_01_b.

- The **flags** can go. We will nog be adding those
- The **cutout model** can go
- In the IFOFILE we can also remove **Dummy_connector_back_1** and **Dummy_joint_back**

![small_feedback_ship_01_b remove](./_sources/blender-14.jpg)

#### What do we have left? What are we going to adapt?

Before we dive into adapting the model we will have a look at what we are going to change and add from the normal Cargo Ship.

##### ANIMATION_SEQUENCES

We will leave the standard animations for this ship. In more advanced tutorials we can adapt those and add more for ourselves.

##### Lamps

We have a FILE_ship_lamp_01. This is a file that hangs on a part of the model and will be giving light when it is dark ingame. We will keep this and maybe even add more lamps.

##### IFOFILE

This file contains a lot of important children.

- BoundingBox_BoundingBox: This is a big box that wraps everything of this scene. Every model, prop, other asset needs to be inside this box. If not, it will be cut off ingame and we will have a visual problem. For example, if we have smoke that goes up, the box needs to be tall enough for the smoke. We will be making our ship bigger, so we will have to scale this box according to the size of our ship and other modifications we will be making.
- MeshBoundingBox_MeshBoundingBox: This is a smaller box as you can see, it only wraps around the model and the meshes of the model. Same logic as for the BoundingBox_BoundingBox, but now only for the model. When we make our model bigger we will have to make sure to also make this BoundingBox bigger.

##### MODEL_small_feedback_ship_b_lod0

The model itself that contains the 3D model of our ship. We will be adapting this model to give it a unique look.

As we have seen for the normal Cargo Ship, the scene can have multiple MODEL files in the tree.

Important to know is that when we export our .cfg file, this export will look up the reference to this model, so the link to the model. The scene does not contain the model itself, but a reference to a file that is somewhere in the folderstructure of your computer. This is important because when moving folders/files this reference can be broken and opening your Blender file can then result in models not showing. That is also why I would advise to create models in the same folder as your data folder where you exported all your building files and use the same folder structure in your mods so when you do move the folder to your mod folder the links would still work. This model also contains the materials and also those are linked, but more about that later in this tutorial.

##### PARTICLE_ship_smoke01

This file is from the PARTICLE type and is the smoke that comes out of the ships chimney. When adapting our ships model, there is a big chance we will have to mode this to make sure it aligns correctly with the chimney.

##### PARTICLE_water_wave_ship_move_01_loop

When the ship floats through the water, the water that hits the ship on the front is a specific visual. The ship splits the water and that has to be visually correct. This PARTICLE makes sure about that. When making the ship bigger we will have to change this PARTICLE also according to the ships size.

##### Other PARTICLES for explosions/damage/debris

As mentioned before, the normal Cargo Ship also has other PARTICLE files. Our new ship existed ingame but would never be attacked or destroyed. Therefore adding those extra PARTICLE files were not needed. We will be copying those over from the normal Cargo Ship to give the same interaction with our new ship.

##### PROPCONTAINER

The PROPCONTAINER contains extra props like barrels, storage things, plants, ect. We already used this in the previous tutorial where we added a tree to our cfg file. If we look at our ship it already has some storage props but when making it bigger we will have more room to place some things and give our asset a nice cargo look.

#### Making the ship bigger/longer

Now, let's dive into changing the model itself. The ship can be a bit bigger and longer. If you have followed the basic Blender tutorials you know we first have to select our model we want to adapt and then switch from **Object Mode** to **Edit mode**.

Select the MODEL you want to create on your scene or select it on the right in the tree structure. If you select it on the right in the tree structure, make sure to select **MODEL** and **not the MAIN_FILE**. The MAIN_FILE contains more then only the model. The only thing we will be adapting now is the model.

For easier changes change the **Viewport Shading** to **Solid mode** in the upper right corner of your screen. In the same line of icons also toggle the **X-Ray** to see the vertices better on all sides of the model.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b adapting step 1](./_sources/blender-15.jpg)

Now let's rotate around the model with our middle mouse button and see where we could adapt the ship. We can adapt the ship at the front and also at the back to make it longer. We can also scale it up as a whole.

Let's start with scaling it up as a whole. If we look at the image above where we compare the ship ingame with the normal Cargo Ship we can see that we can double the size easily.

Make sure you are in **Edit Mode** and you have selected all the vertices. They should all look orange. Rotate around it with the middle mouse button to make sure they are all selected. If not make sure you toggled the **X-Ray** on in the upper right corner to be able to see and select vertices behind other vertices. Also make sure the **Object Proporties** panel is open where we can see the location and scale of our selected model.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b adapting step 2](./_sources/blender-16.jpg)

We can see that our ships location is x=0 y=0 and z=0.168953. We should change this. We want our model to be in the middle of our scene for every value, so x and y should are 0 but we also change this for the z value. We see that our ship sank a bit lower. For now this is fine.

First we could copy (SHIFT + D) the same model to compare after when we have scaled our model. Now let's scale our model from 1.100 to 2.000 for all values and see if we did not went overboard with this. At first glance, this is fine. We can always come back to this if we see ingame that it is actually to big. Now delete the smaller model.

**NOTE**: By scaling the whole ship we also scale things like the door, windows. Those are now not in proportion anymore if we would add people as animations on the ship. We leave this for this tutorial to not go to deep into the modelling yet.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b adapting step scale](./_sources/blender-17.jpg)

We immediatly see that all of our other assets (PARTICLE, FILE,...) do not match the correct location anymore. We will come back to those once we finished the whole model.

Now that we have made it bigger, let's make it longer at the front and the back. To have a good view click on NUMPAD 1 to have a rearview of the scene. Make sure you have selected the model, that you are in Edit Mode, you have toggled X-Ray view and you are in the Solid Viewport Mode.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b adapting step rear view](./_sources/blender-18.jpg)

Now select all vertices of the front of the ship that we want to move to the left to make the ship longer fromt the front.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b adapting step front adapt](./_sources/blender-19.jpg)

We can now move all those vertices to the left bij useing the **shorcut G** for dragging and use the middle mouse button to stay on the X-axis and move our mouse as far as we want. We can also use the move tool on the left.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b adapting step front adapt 2](./_sources/blender-20.jpg)

If we switch to **Material Preview Mode** we can see that the material is stretched really clearly. We will be adapting our material later, but to minimize this stretching we could adapt our vertices a bit.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b adapting step front adapt impact material](./_sources/blender-21.jpg)

We can see that the front part that we moved exists from 3 big parts. We could spread the length according to those different parts to minimize the streching as much as we can. Select the last range of vertices and move those back a bit.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b adapting step front adapt impact material 2](./_sources/blender-22.jpg)

Do this for the other parts to have a balanced stretch.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b adapting step front adapt impact material 3](./_sources/blender-23.jpg)

Now that we have done this for the front, we could also do this for the back. Again select the vertices we want to move to make it bigger.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b adapting step back adapt 1](./_sources/blender-24.jpg)
![small_feedback_ship_01_b adapting step back adapt 2](./_sources/blender-25.jpg)

We have now created some more space on the ship to put some extra cargo. The last step we can do is removing the flag pole at the end of the ship. We can select the vertices and delete them.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b adapting step cargo](./_sources/blender-26.jpg)

As we look closer, we can see that some parts of the original materials are really stretched. Some are more noticable then others, but ingame most of it will probably not be seen from far away. We will do some polishing when adapting the materials. But for this tutorial we are not going to go to deep into adapting those textures. We want to give a basic knowledge of adapting existing models in Blender.

**NOTE:** If you did not do this already, it is wise to save your work as a Blender file. So you can always come back to this file and adapt if needed.

### Adapting other assets

Now that we have adapted the model, it is time to adapt/move/add all the other elements on our scene. We talked already about those above, so this should go smooth. Make sure you are back in **Object Mode** and NOT in Edit mode.

When moving the objects, make sure to move the parent and not one of the children. Otherwise ingame your asset will not be at the right location.

Lets move the light FILE to the correct location

![small_feedback_ship_01_b adapting lamp](./_sources/blender-27.jpg)

Let's move the smoke PARTICLE and scale it to make it a bit bigger.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b adapting smoke](./_sources/blender-28.jpg)

Scale and move the PARTICLE for the water waves.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b adapting wave](./_sources/blender-29.jpg)

### Adding other assets for explosions and damage

We still have our MAIN_FILE of our Cargo Ship. Open this and drag + SHIFT over as much PARTICLE files as you want to the MAIN_FILE of our new ship. We will take 1 or 2 of every aspect (debris, explosion, smoke, ship damage, shot miss, splash.) When adding those to the other MAIN_FILE to location should be correctly and you should not have to drag it.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b Particles](./_sources/blender-30.jpg)

Now open the IFOFILE of our normal Cargo Ship and see what we can take from that. We have some Dummy files for damage impact, fire, hits. We can reuse those. And again, drag those to our other MAIN_FILE, but now make sure they are inside the IFOFILE.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b IFOFILE](./_sources/blender-31.jpg)

As you can see our tree is getting more complex with the more assets. The last step we are going to take is adding extra props to our ship. We have some space to add some woodem crates, boxes, ect to give it a nice cargo ship feeling. For adding props, we need a PROPCONTAINER. We can reuse the one from the Cargo Ship. Remove everything inside and drag it over to the MAIN_FILE of our other ship. We can now also completly delete the MAIN_FILE of our normal Cargo Ship.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b PROPS](./_sources/blender-32.jpg)

First of all, select your PROPSCONTAINER and look at the **Object Proporties** panel. Make sure the location of this PROPCONTAINER is x=0 y=0 z=0. This is important because all added props will be ingame positioned on this coordinates of this parent.

To add props (.prp files) to you scene, we will be useing again the import function with the amazing Anno add-on. If we dive into our folder structure that we exported we can find a specific folder where we can find all the storage props. Barrels, wooden creates, other piles of storage materials. **data/graphics/props/storage**.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b PROPS storage path](./_sources/blender-33.jpg)

To add one of the props to our scene:

- Select the PROPCONTAINER in the tree view
- Go to **File** > **Import** > **Anno Prop (.prp)** > And **open the .prp file** you want to add.

**NOTE:** Only when selecting the PROPCONTAINER the option to import the .prp files will be available. If you did not select the PROPCONTAINER it will be greyed out.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b PROPS storage import](./_sources/blender-34.jpg)

You can immediatly move the prop around at the correct place. Always make sure to move the highest parent of the prop and not the children. In this case the PROP file and not the PROPCONTAINER and not the Mesh inside.

![small_feedback_ship_01_b PROPS storage import 2](./_sources/blender-35.jpg)

Add as many props as you want and go creative!

![small_feedback_ship_01_b PROPS storage result](./_sources/blender-36.jpg)

We are now finished with changing, adding, editing, ect in Blender. We can now export!

### Exporting

We did jump over some things that we now have to have extra attention for. To start, we have adapted and existing model to a new model. When exporting our file to a .cfg to use ingame, the file still thinks that we are using the old version of the model. So if we would export this we would still see the old model ingame instead of our changed model.

#### Exporting model

To export our adapted model, first change the name of the model from **MODEL_small_feedback_ship_b_lod0** to **MODEL_small_cargo_ship** in the tree view.

![small cargo ship name](./_sources/blender-37.jpg)

Now that we selected this model, we can export it. So we will be creating a new model of our ship.

- Make sure you select **MODEL_small_cargo_ship** in the tree view
- Go to **File** > **Export** > **Anno Model (.rdm/.glb)**

![small cargo ship export 1](./_sources/blender-38.jpg)

- Navigate to the original **vehicle** folder where all the exported buildings and assets can be found.
- Make a new folder inside the vehicle folder and name it **small_cargo_ship**
- Open this folder
- Make 2 new folders inside this folder named **maps** and **rdm**
- Open the **rdm** folder and save your model (small_cargo_ship.rdm) inside this folder.

Now if you navigate to this folder on your computer you will see 2 files you just created. A .glb file and a .rdm file. You can open the .glb file with the standard 3D viewer from windows and you will see the model you created in 3D preview, without any materials or props or particles.

![small cargo ship glb](./_sources/blender-39.jpg)

Now if we go back to Blender, we have to link our new model to the model in our file. To do so we use the **Anno Object panel**. This is a bit hidden. It can be found underneath the Viewport Shading buttons. It is an arrow that will open a couple of panels, one of those panels is the Anno Object Panel.

![small cargo ship Anno Object 1](./_sources/blender-40.jpg)

Look at the FileName of the Anno Object. This should be the link to the correct model. Sometimes Blender did not pick up the exported rdm yet and then you have to manually link this here. In my case this is correct.

![small cargo ship Anno Object 2](./_sources/blender-41.jpg)

#### Exporting .cfg

It is time to export our whole asset to a .cfg file, the file that contains our model, props, assets, particles, smoke, and other logic of the asset.

To export our .cfg file we need:

- Select our **MAIN_FILE_small_cargo_ship** in our tree view.
- Go to **File** > **Export** > **Anno (.cfg)**
- We save this .cfg file in our **data/graphics/vehicle/small_cargo_ship/** folder

### Changing the material

If we have a look at the ship we see that this is red. I would like to change that to a more black-grey color.

Let's find the original material file. From the previous tutorial we know that we have different types of material files. diff, mask, metal and norm.

We will only adapt the diff version. The other versions can stay the same.

We can find the material files of the original ship in the same location where we could find the .cfg file. **data/graphics/vehicle/small_feedback_ship_01/maps**. The file **small_feedback_ship_01_diff_0.dds** is the highest quality file we can adapt. First we convert this file from .dds to .png like we did before.
To convert the dds file we can use different tools:

- https://www.xnview.com/
- https://www.aconvert.com/image/dds-to-png/

Let's open this diff map in our preferred editing program and change colors the way we want. I changed the red color to a black-grey color to have some visual difference.

![small cargo ship diff map 2](./_sources/blender-42.jpg)
![small cargo ship diff map 3](./_sources/blender-43.jpg)

Also make sure to make the different versions.

- small_cargo_ship_diff_0 (1024x512)
- small_cargo_ship_diff_1 (512x256)
- small_cargo_ship_diff_2 (256x128)
- small_cargo_ship_diff_3 (128x64)
- small_cargo_ship_diff_4 (64x32)

Covert those .png files to .dds files. and move all those files inside our **maps** folder inside our **small_cargo_ship** vehicle folder.

### Link the new materials in Blender

We go back to Blender to link our new created materials to our model.

We change our workspace to **Shading**. And we can see the linked diff material.

![small cargo ship diff map blender](./_sources/blender-44.jpg)

Change the linked material to our newly created diff map.

![small cargo ship diff map blender 2](./_sources/blender-45.jpg)

### Export .cfg again

Now select the **MAIN_FILE_small_cargo_ship** agian in the tree and export the .cfg again and overwrite the files we previously created.

### Moving our ship folder to our mod folder

We are now finished with our ship and can copy the folder to our mod folder. Copy the **data/graphics/vehicle/small_cargo_ship/** folder to our mod and make sure the structure is the same.

Before you forget, change the path to the .cfg again in the main assets.xml.

```XML
<Object>
    <Variations>
        <Item>
            <Filename>data/graphics/vehicle/small_cargo_ship/small_cargo_ship.cfg</Filename>
        </Item>
    </Variations>
</Object>
```

Copy the mod folder again to the Anno 1800 mod folder and start the game. We should see everything we created ingame. execpt the icon. But more about that later.

![small cargo ship ingame wrong](./_sources/blender-46.jpg)

I encounter a couple of things now ingame. I could completly fix this from the start in this tutorial, but it is actually a good lesson in debugging, so I'll just keep this in.

- ship is sideways
- ship is to big. Factor x2 is way to much
- no props to be seen that we placed on the model
- destruction of the ship does not work

#### Fix problems

First of all, the ship is sideways. Not good offcourse. Looking at the model in Blender is is clear why. Some of the rotation values were not set to 0 or the correct 1.

![small cargo ship sideways 1](./_sources/blender-47.jpg)

We can fix this by changing our Rotation W=1.000 and Z=0.000.

![small cargo ship sideways fix 1](./_sources/blender-48.jpg)

All our props and particles are offcourse also not positioned correct anymore.

I also see that we forgot to change the Boundingboxes in the IFOFILE. But first we better change the size so we can adapt everything according to that.

Select the model and instead of scale 2.000 lets just keep it at 1.000.

Now move all the props, particles, scale the boundingboxes,... to make sure everything is correct.

Now export the MODEL and MAIN_FILE again. Copy the folder again to your Mod folder and then copy the modfolder again to your Anno mod folder to test it ingame if it works now.

### Creating the icon

We will create an icon based on the ingame model. But because we do not have it final yet, we will do this once we have the other things in order.

# !!!! REMARK !!!!

This tutorial is not finished yet! There are still problems I encountered and things I probably did wrong and need to fix. So, if you follow this tutorial and you see where I made mistakes, feel free to contact me. I will rework the tutorial with the correct information once I find the time.
