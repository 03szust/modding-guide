# WIP Tutorial Quests, written by Serp:

This tutorial will show you how to create quests and how to properly start them. 
 
I will use GUIDs from the personal GUID Range: https://github.com/anno-mods/GuidRanges?tab=readme-ov-file#personal-guid-range  
If you plan to publish your mod, make sure to reserve your own GUID Range there to not conflict with other mods.
