# LUA API guides/infos

Anno 1800 has an internal lua API that it uses to communicate between UI and Game. There were some small scripts added in Season 4, but for the most part, the lua API serves this purpose.

(Serp:) There is no official documentation and lua was not ment for modding and even in vanilla nearly never used, so don't expect too much from it.
